### This is a parameter file. It's assumed that you're preparing it
### according to below syntax rules.

### Keywords are: 'arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3', 'arg4', 'arg5', 'arg6' and
### 'name'. After keyword there _must_ follow a ':' character.
### Then - the variable itself. 

### Say, if you want first parameter of function to be a 0x001245A0 then
### yuo should insert in this file a _unique_ entry: 'arg1:001245A0'.
### Attention: absence of starting '0x' for unsigned hexadecimal variable
### matters! And presence of beginning zeroes '00.....' (to set variable's
### length to 8 characters) also matters.

### If you want your function to be registered in Behoerde under name
### SomeNiceName, then you should insert in this file a unique entry:
### 'name:SomeNiceName'. Attention: only first 15 characters of function's
### name are of meaning.

### Commented line starts with '#' character. Each line organized not
### according to prescribed above syntax rules gets ignored.
